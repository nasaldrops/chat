This app works using Whatsapp and Twilio.
I followed this tutorial to set up the bulk of the code:

# This is important - Ngrok
You will need to register for ngrok's **free tier account** otherwise it will not work for you.

Create a file, call it .env and add this to it:
    
    OPENAI_API_KEY = lkldjflgkjdfLKJLKHLKHIH7889879h

    Don't put quotes or anything around it.
    
    Be sure not to expose your API.
